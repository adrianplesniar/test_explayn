In this article, instead of comparing the particular locations, we&#8217;ll focus on the benefits you can count on when outsourcing design and development to this region.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eastern Europe is known for its endless reservoir of highly skilled web developers, but their know-how is only one of the benefits you can count on when switching to this form of outsourcing. What else can you expect as an entrepreneur?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#1 Customer-centric approach</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A customer-centric approach is undoubtedly a foundation of success in the modern market. And, as <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/327524/bring-customers-clear-focus.aspx\">Gallup&#8217;s report</a> shows, it makes the employees more optimistic about the company&#8217;s future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The USA-based companies approach the cooperation with the European specialists quite cautiously due to the stereotype of low-quality client service. Fortunately, it is untrue &#8211; particularly when it comes to Eastern Europe. Are you worried that the outsourcing companies from that region still struggle with the post-soviet legacy when it comes to customer approach? Worry not &#8211; their relatively young capitalism tips the balance on the opposite side.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just as demanding American customers are a cliché in Europe, so is the low-quality European customer service in the US. The Eastern-European outsourcing companies usually represent as much customer-centric approach as the US enterprises.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#2 High-quality service at a fair cost</b></h2>\n<p>Cutting costs is not always a goal of primary importance for the enterprises that decide to try out an outsourcing-based business model. Sometimes, it is just a side effect. Nevertheless, in most cases, outsourcing (including nearshoring) is followed by cost reduction as a natural consequence. Putting it simply &#8211; it&#8217;s hard not to save when not hiring full-time employees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With increased efficiency that usually follows outsourcing, saving is even easier. For the outsourcing partners, it actually pays off to be efficient. The faster they finish the project (without compromising quality), the faster they are able to kick off with the next one. And you can introduce the product to the market even faster than you expected. It’s a win-win!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Delegating work to external specialists in Eastern Europe may allow you to reduce the operational costs, since the rates in these countries are much lower. As a foreign customer, you can offer them much more attractive rates than the domestic ones while still saving quite a lot. Thus, you can remain fair while achieving your business goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#3 A fresh approach to design</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eastern Europe is a complicated region where different cultural and esthetical influences would merge through the centuries. The late capitalism has created a different timeline of design development. Today, many of these countries &#8211; particularly Poland &#8211; are known for their innovative approach to design.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the projects from this region, simplicity and intuitiveness meet attention to detail and unconventional ideas. In many Western countries, the interfaces that work well are kept the same, but not in Eastern Europe. Here, the designers are always searching for the solutions that will make them work even better.</p>\n<h2><b>Offshoring to the Eastern Europe vs. Far East</b></h2>\n<p>Outsourcing design and development services to the Far East was a dominating business model worldwide a few years ago. Today, many US-based companies switch to Eastern Europe. There are a few reasons for that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>#1 More acceptable time difference </b></h3>\n<p>The time difference between the USA locations and India, the Philippines, Indonesia, or other popular Far East outsourcing locations makes it hard to navigate successful cooperation. For instance, the time difference between the Los Angeles and New Delhi is over 12 hours.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus, if the partnering companies work in conventional hours, it&#8217;s practically impossible to find a time slot during the day when both of them are available. In the case of Eastern European countries, it&#8217;s much easier to tune in with the meeting hours.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>#2 Similarities in business culture</b></h3>\n<p>It is not uncommon that different business cultures set the companies apart. The working culture defines the approach to business relationships, deadlines, and communication habits. If these values don&#8217;t &#8222;click&#8221;, the business partners may expect some issues affecting the overall effectiveness. It is not the result of bad faith &#8211; most of these mechanisms are unconscious.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In general, the further the two countries are from each other, the more distant they are in terms of business culture. Of course, there are exceptions, which mainly refer to countries with a colonial past. Europe is quite homogenous when it comes to working culture &#8211; and working with the European outsourcing company (regardless of its exact location), you can expect them to share Western values.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>#3 EU regulations</b></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Aside from the few Balkan countries, the Eastern part of Europe consists mainly of EU members. The <a href=\"https://www.n-ix.com/it-outsourcing-destinations-eastern-europe-market-report/\">highest-ranked outsourcing locations</a> in this part of the continent, like Poland, Bulgaria, or Hungary, are all within the EU.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the EU regulations regarding intellectual property and data protection, the risk of abuse in this field is much lower. In the case of popular offshoring locations outside of Europe, these issues are not regulated, what puts you at a higher risk as a customer of an outsourcing company.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The European Union law regulates transaction-related affairs such as taxation, too. Thus, the cooperation is based on clear conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>#4 Similar UI/UX habits</b></h3>\n<p>The Western world shares not only the same values but also associations and habits. For designers that come from outside of it, it may be much harder to pick up the aspects that influence the user experience in a negative way.  Eastern European designers will easily decode the associations generated by colors, shapes, and particular layouts.

In this article, instead of comparing the particular locations, we&#8217;ll focus on the benefits you can count on when outsourcing design and development to this region.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eastern Europe is known for its endless reservoir of highly skilled web developers, but their know-how is only one of the benefits you can count on when switching to this form of outsourcing. What else can you expect as an entrepreneur?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#1 Customer-centric approach</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A customer-centric approach is undoubtedly a foundation of success in the modern market. And, as <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/327524/bring-customers-clear-focus.aspx\">Gallup&#8217;s report</a> shows, it makes the employees more optimistic about the company&#8217;s future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The USA-based companies approach the cooperation with the European specialists quite cautiously due to the stereotype of low-quality client service. Fortunately, it is untrue &#8211; particularly when it comes to Eastern Europe. Are you worried that the outsourcing companies from that region still struggle with the post-soviet legacy when it comes to customer approach? Worry not &#8211; their relatively young capitalism tips the balance on the opposite side.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just as demanding American customers are a cliché in Europe, so is the low-quality European customer service in the US. The Eastern-European outsourcing companies usually represent as much customer-centric approach as the US enterprises.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#2 High-quality service at a fair cost</b></h2>\n<p>Cutting costs is not always a goal of primary importance for the enterprises that decide to try out an outsourcing-based business model. Sometimes, it is just a side effect. Nevertheless, in most cases, outsourcing (including nearshoring) is followed by cost reduction as a natural consequence. Putting it simply &#8211; it&#8217;s hard not to save when not hiring full-time employees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With increased efficiency that usually follows outsourcing, saving is even easier. For the outsourcing partners, it actually pays off to be efficient. The faster they finish the project (without compromising quality), the faster they are able to kick off with the next one. And you can introduce the product to the market even faster than you expected. It’s a win-win!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Delegating work to external specialists in Eastern Europe may allow you to reduce the operational costs, since the rates in these countries are much lower. As a foreign customer, you can offer them much more attractive rates than the domestic ones while still saving quite a lot. Thus, you can remain fair while achieving your business goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#3 A fresh approach to design</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eastern Europe is a complicated region where different cultural and esthetical influences would merge through the centuries. The late capitalism has created a different timeline of design development. Today, many of these countries &#8211; particularly Poland &#8211; are known for their innovative approach to design.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the projects from this region, simplicity and intuitiveness meet attention to detail and unconventional ideas. In many Western countries, the interfaces that work well are kept the same, but not in Eastern Europe. Here, the designers are always searching for the solutions that will make them work even better.</p>\n<h2><b>Offshoring to the Eastern Europe vs. Far East</b></h2>\n<p>Outsourcing design and development services to the Far East was a dominating business model worldwide a few years ago. Today, many US-based companies switch to Eastern Europe. There are a few reasons for that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>#1 More acceptable time difference </b></h3>\n<p>The time difference between the USA locations and India, the Philippines, Indonesia, or other popular Far East outsourcing locations makes it hard to navigate successful cooperation. For instance, the time difference between the Los Angeles and New Delhi is over 12 hours.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus, if the partnering companies work in conventional hours, it&#8217;s practically impossible to find a time slot during the day when both of them are available. In the case of Eastern European countries, it&#8217;s much easier to tune in with the meeting hours.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>#2 Similarities in business culture</b></h3>\n<p>It is not uncommon that different business cultures set the companies apart. The working culture defines the approach to business relationships, deadlines, and communication habits. If these values don&#8217;t &#8222;click&#8221;, the business partners may expect some issues affecting the overall effectiveness. It is not the result of bad faith &#8211; most of these mechanisms are unconscious.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In general, the further the two countries are from each other, the more distant they are in terms of business culture. Of course, there are exceptions, which mainly refer to countries with a colonial past. Europe is quite homogenous when it comes to working culture &#8211; and working with the European outsourcing company (regardless of its exact location), you can expect them to share Western values.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>#3 EU regulations</b></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Aside from the few Balkan countries, the Eastern part of Europe consists mainly of EU members. The <a href=\"https://www.n-ix.com/it-outsourcing-destinations-eastern-europe-market-report/\">highest-ranked outsourcing locations</a> in this part of the continent, like Poland, Bulgaria, or Hungary, are all within the EU.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the EU regulations regarding intellectual property and data protection, the risk of abuse in this field is much lower. In the case of popular offshoring locations outside of Europe, these issues are not regulated, what puts you at a higher risk as a customer of an outsourcing company.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The European Union law regulates transaction-related affairs such as taxation, too. Thus, the cooperation is based on clear conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>PL #4 Similar UI/UX habits</b></h3>\n<p>The Western world shares not only the same values but also associations and habits. For designers that come from outside of it, it may be much harder to pick up the aspects that influence the user experience in a negative way.  Eastern European designers will easily decode the associations generated by colors, shapes, and particular layouts. They&#8217;ll be able to choose button placements and graphics that cause an expected user reaction, making it easier for you to increase conversion rates and achieve business goals.</p>\n","leadText":"PL In the area of development and design outsourcing services, Eastern Europe is currently one of the big players in the market.

Subsequently, we've made two video ads aimed at the YouTube campaigns to take off with the promotion in the most efficient way.

Since it aims towards a personalization, the company’s offer had to be as customizable as possible. That’s why all the diet variants have at least five levels of caloric content, and the clients can personalize their orders during the purchase process.  At the same time, the competition in the diet catering sector is relatively high, regardless of the price range. To attract potential customers, an extended offer adjusted to different needs and diet restrictions is not enough. ","torbasmaku.case-work-project.p2":"Thus, an intuitive website that catches the eye with its modern layout was our starting point, followed by a well-targeted marketing campaign.  Since it’s not that easy to stand out from the multitude of companies offering relatively similar catering services, we had to choose one distinguishing feature to focus on, which is, in a nutshell, „cheap but good” (with an emphasis on good!).","torbasmaku.case-work-project.p3":" ","torbasmaku.case-work-structure.h2":"Research and structure","torbasmaku.case-work-structure.p1":"During the research phase, we came up with a conclusion that the office workers dominate among the company’s target groups. Since they’re busy, they usually search for the fastest solutions. Thus, when designing the user journey, we’ve tried to reduce the order process to four simple steps. This way, the client can finalize the order in a minute or two. Through the website, the clients of Torba Smaku can access the client panel, where all their previous and current orders are stored. They can modify them, add special requests and manage their payments.","torbasmaku.case-work-structure.p2":" ","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.h2":"Aesthetics","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.p1":"In the website’s color palette, pastel shades are dominating, with mint green and pale blue as the main ones.

However, we’ve left much space for white, going for a modern, transparent design that exposes the appetizing photographs of offered dishes. ","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.p2":"We’ve made them in minimalistic arrangements, keeping the shots simple to bring out the maximum potential of the meals. Each diet is illustrated with various photos to give the potential clients an exact idea of what they can expect. The readable, sans serif Work Sans and Poppins fonts are in perfect harmony with the design. The modern approach to UI design distinguishes Torba Smaku from other companies in this price range, as most of them still operate on quite old-school interfaces.","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.p3":" ","torbasmaku.case-work-development.h2":"Website","torbasmaku.case-work-development.p1":"Since most clients tend to order diet catering services online, a fully responsive, beautiful online platform was a must.
