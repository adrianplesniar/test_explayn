If you have a part of the work already done, we obviously won&#8217;t make you start all over again. Instead, we&#8217;ll try to make the best out of the provided materials.</p>\n<h2><b>I. The discovery phase</b></h2>\n<p>Once you reach out to us to consult your idea or concept, we won&#8217;t hop into designing right away. First, we need to put the pieces of information together to give the project a solid base. To do so, we should arrange at least one meeting. We can do it in person or online &#8211; it&#8217;s up to you. You can invite your business partners and project team if you feel that you&#8217;ll all benefit from it.</p>\n<p>During the series of consultations, we set up the business goals assigned to this particular project. Relying on the available data, we analyze your existing audience or specify a target one, to fully understand its expectations and needs. That comes in handy when creating personas that facilitate the optimization of the interface and content. This way, we make sure that the final result will be as converting as it can.</p>\n<p><b>What do we need at this point:</b> an idea or a project outline (if you already have one)</p>\n<p><b>What do we end up with: </b>defined target audience, goals, and, in the end, a tailored strategy that will enable us to develop a refined website</p>\n<p><b>How will we do it? </b>Through a series of consulting sessions, brainstorming, and competition analysis</p>\n<h2><b>II. The planning phase</b></h2>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve specified which direction we want to head, we can pave the way to refined effect with thorough planning. This phase may seem the least energy-consuming, but we&#8217;d risk stating that the project&#8217;s success depends on it. It allows to organize the whole process and set up the expectations regarding deadlines and the exact budget.</p>\n<p><b>What do we need at this point: </b>A strategy that clearly points out the effect we want to achieve and the way to do it</p>\n<p><b>What do we end up with: </b>Project timeline, website structure, design concept</p>\n<p><b>How will we do it: </b>through consulting sessions, estimation &amp; work management tools, and UX design methods such as wireframing and user journey mapping</p>\n<h2><b>III. Design</b></h2>\n<p>Now, that&#8217;s the phase we love the most! Seeing the concepts worked out during hours of brainstorming sessions materializing on the screen feels truly rewarding.</p>\n<p>Even the most trendy interfaces won&#8217;t serve their purpose without a thoughtfully designed structure and navigation. But the trends matter too &#8211; there is no doubt about that! We will try to stay in line with some of them, while maintaining a distinctive character of the website and adding elements that will make it stand out. If you want to know more about the leading tendencies in UI/UX design, check our article.</p>\n<p>2D or 3D? Typical static website or an interactive project that includes motion graphics? One showcase webpage or a multi-page structured project? If you&#8217;re not sure what direction to take, we can figure it out together.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What do we need at this point: </b>A general concept of the website: aesthetics, wireframes, architecture, user experience</p>\n<p><b>What do we end up with: </b>Refined interface designed to the smallest detail: color palette, typography, background, spacing, icons, widgets, illustrations, animations, and everything else necessary to construct a beautiful website.</p>\n<p><b>How will we do it: </b>using design tools such as Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, Animate, etc.</p>\n<h2><b>IV. Development</b></h2>\n<p>Once we&#8217;ve got all this concept captured in visual elements, it&#8217;s time to bring it into life with the code. If you decide to go with the static website, the mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be just enough. However, in the case of interactive interfaces, we&#8217;ll need to work on the back end as well.</p>\n<p>Polishing that side is essential for e-commerce websites and web apps based on interactions. It&#8217;s not just any code &#8211; the choice of a back-end framework determines the website&#8217;s performance. We&#8217;re flexible in this respect, using Node JS, JavaScript, and Ruby &#8211; just to name a few. Considering that smartphone users are beginning to take over the market, we&#8217;ll make sure that your website is optimized for mobile interfaces, too.</p>\n<p><b>What do we need at this point: </b>a complete project with all the static elements designed, verified and accepted by the contractor</p>\n<p><b>What do we end up with: </b>a coded website that works seamlessly on mobile and desktop interfaces</p>\n<p><b>How will we do it: </b>with appropriately selected coding frameworks (Next.js, React/react native, Graph.ql, Node.js, Typescript, Ruby, JavaScript)</p>\n<h2><b>What sets our approach apart?</b></h2>\n<p>At Explayn, we put emphasis on versatility without compromising the quality of any project&#8217;s segment. Knowing that the cooperation of a few outsourced teams can result in delays and communication disruptions, we&#8217;ve decided to deliver an alternative. The one-step solution can eliminate these problems and increase the coherency of the brand&#8217;s visual identity and voice. Instead of spreading the work between few companies, you can choose one that handles both the design and development process and taking care of branding and the marketing strategy.</p>\n","leadText":"When searching for a reliable development partner, it's not uncommon to get discouraged after looking through the few first landing pages. A lot of jargon and not much content - in a nutshell, that's what the problem comes down to. The development process can adopt slightly different forms, but generally, its components are fixed. Today, we‚Äôd like to show you how we do it in Explayn, using a transparent vocabulary and placing its stages on a timeline. The article may help you understand its intricacies and give you an idea of its proper course.

If you have a part of the work already done, we obviously won&#8217;t make you start all over again. Instead, we&#8217;ll try to make the best out of the provided materials.</p>\n<h2><b>I. The discovery phase</b></h2>\n<p>Once you reach out to us to consult your idea or concept, we won&#8217;t hop into designing right away. First, we need to put the pieces of information together to give the project a solid base. To do so, we should arrange at least one meeting. We can do it in person or online &#8211; it&#8217;s up to you. You can invite your business partners and project team if you feel that you&#8217;ll all benefit from it.</p>\n<p>During the series of consultations, we set up the business goals assigned to this particular project. Relying on the available data, we analyze your existing audience or specify a target one, to fully understand its expectations and needs. That comes in handy when creating personas that facilitate the optimization of the interface and content. This way, we make sure that the final result will be as converting as it can.</p>\n<p><b>What do we need at this point:</b> an idea or a project outline (if you already have one)</p>\n<p><b>What do we end up with: </b>defined target audience, goals, and, in the end, a tailored strategy that will enable us to develop a refined website</p>\n<p><b>How will we do it? </b>Through a series of consulting sessions, brainstorming, and competition analysis</p>\n<h2><b>II. The planning phase</b></h2>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve specified which direction we want to head, we can pave the way to refined effect with thorough planning. This phase may seem the least energy-consuming, but we&#8217;d risk stating that the project&#8217;s success depends on it. It allows to organize the whole process and set up the expectations regarding deadlines and the exact budget.</p>\n<p><b>What do we need at this point: </b>A strategy that clearly points out the effect we want to achieve and the way to do it</p>\n<p><b>What do we end up with: </b>Project timeline, website structure, design concept</p>\n<p><b>How will we do it: </b>through consulting sessions, estimation &amp; work management tools, and UX design methods such as wireframing and user journey mapping</p>\n<h2><b>III. Design</b></h2>\n<p>Now, that&#8217;s the phase we love the most! Seeing the concepts worked out during hours of brainstorming sessions materializing on the screen feels truly rewarding.</p>\n<p>Even the most trendy interfaces won&#8217;t serve their purpose without a thoughtfully designed structure and navigation. But the trends matter too &#8211; there is no doubt about that! We will try to stay in line with some of them, while maintaining a distinctive character of the website and adding elements that will make it stand out. If you want to know more about the leading tendencies in UI/UX design, check our article.</p>\n<p>2D or 3D? Typical static website or an interactive project that includes motion graphics? One showcase webpage or a multi-page structured project? If you&#8217;re not sure what direction to take, we can figure it out together.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What do we need at this point: </b>A general concept of the website: aesthetics, wireframes, architecture, user experience</p>\n<p><b>What do we end up with: </b>Refined interface designed to the smallest detail: color palette, typography, background, spacing, icons, widgets, illustrations, animations, and everything else necessary to construct a beautiful website.</p>\n<p><b>How will we do it: </b>using design tools such as Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, Animate, etc.</p>\n<h2><b>IV. Development</b></h2>\n<p>Once we&#8217;ve got all this concept captured in visual elements, it&#8217;s time to bring it into life with the code. If you decide to go with the static website, the mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be just enough. However, in the case of interactive interfaces, we&#8217;ll need to work on the back end as well.</p>\n<p>Polishing that side is essential for e-commerce websites and web apps based on interactions. It&#8217;s not just any code &#8211; the choice of a back-end framework determines the website&#8217;s performance. We&#8217;re flexible in this respect, using Node JS, JavaScript, and Ruby &#8211; just to name a few. Considering that smartphone users are beginning to take over the market, we&#8217;ll make sure that your website is optimized for mobile interfaces, too.</p>\n<p><b>What do we need at this point: </b>a complete project with all the static elements designed, verified and accepted by the contractor</p>\n<p><b>What do we end up with: </b>a coded website that works seamlessly on mobile and desktop interfaces</p>\n<p><b>How will we do it: </b>with appropriately selected coding frameworks (Next.js, React/react native, Graph.ql, Node.js, Typescript, Ruby, JavaScript)</p>\n<h2><b>What sets our approach apart?</b></h2>\n<p>At Explayn, we put emphasis on versatility without compromising the quality of any project&#8217;s segment. Knowing that the cooperation of a few outsourced teams can result in delays and communication disruptions, we&#8217;ve decided to deliver an alternative. The one-step solution can eliminate these problems and increase the coherency of the brand&#8217;s visual identity and voice. Instead of spreading the work between few companies, you can choose one that handles both the design and development process and taking care of branding and the marketing strategy.</p>\n","leadText":"When searching for a reliable development partner, it's not uncommon to get discouraged after looking through the few first landing pages.

At the same time, the competition in the diet catering sector is relatively high, regardless of the price range. To attract potential customers, an extended offer adjusted to different needs and diet restrictions is not enough. ","torbasmaku.case-work-project.p2":"Thus, an intuitive website that catches the eye with its modern layout was our starting point, followed by a well-targeted marketing campaign.  Since it‚Äôs not that easy to stand out from the multitude of companies offering relatively similar catering services, we had to choose one distinguishing feature to focus on, which is, in a nutshell, ‚Äûcheap but good‚Äù (with an emphasis on good!).","torbasmaku.case-work-project.p3":" ","torbasmaku.case-work-structure.h2":"Research and structure","torbasmaku.case-work-structure.p1":"During the research phase, we came up with a conclusion that the office workers dominate among the company‚Äôs target groups. Since they‚Äôre busy, they usually search for the fastest solutions. Thus, when designing the user journey, we‚Äôve tried to reduce the order process to four simple steps. This way, the client can finalize the order in a minute or two. Through the website, the clients of Torba Smaku can access the client panel, where all their previous and current orders are stored. They can modify them, add special requests and manage their payments.","torbasmaku.case-work-structure.p2":" ","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.h2":"Aesthetics","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.p1":"In the website‚Äôs color palette, pastel shades are dominating, with mint green and pale blue as the main ones. Green brings calmness and associations with nature and harmony, while blue evokes trust. However, we‚Äôve left much space for white, going for a modern, transparent design that exposes the appetizing photographs of offered dishes. ","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.p2":"We‚Äôve made them in minimalistic arrangements, keeping the shots simple to bring out the maximum potential of the meals. Each diet is illustrated with various photos to give the potential clients an exact idea of what they can expect. The readable, sans serif Work Sans and Poppins fonts are in perfect harmony with the design. The modern approach to UI design distinguishes Torba Smaku from other companies in this price range, as most of them still operate on quite old-school interfaces.","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.p3":" ","torbasmaku.case-work-development.h2":"Website","torbasmaku.case-work-development.p1":"Since most clients tend to order diet catering services online, a fully responsive, beautiful online platform was a must. We made sure that the website is intuitive on different devices, including smartphones which are taking over the online traffic (in 2021, they already constitute 54% of all global traffic on the Internet).","torbasmaku.case-work-marketing.h2.marketing":"Marketing ","torbasmaku.case-work-marketing.h2.campaing":"campaing","torbasmaku.case-work-marketing.p1":"Marketing campaign: The introduction of the new brand to the market could go unnoticed without a well-targeted brand promotion. Our client decided to bet on a YouTube campaign since it‚Äôs the easiest way to reach broad recognition within a short time. To reach out to clients through social media, we‚Äôve used Facebook Ads, too. Google Ads campaign made up to the overall promotion, allowing us to access the target group directly and spark its interest. ","torbasmaku.case-work-visual.h2":"Video ads","torbasmaku.case-work-visual.p1":"Our job was to create two video ads with the brand ambassador - Micha≈Ç Wi≈õniewski, a known musician. Since he‚Äôs not related to the gastronomy industry anyhow, finding the common ground wasn‚Äôt easy. We came up with an idea of a musical kitchen. To create a commercial jingle, we‚Äôve used the kitchen sounds, combining them with Micha≈Ç‚Äôs vocal.","torbasmaku.case-work-visual.p2":" ","case-data.country":"Country","case-data.client":"Client","case-data.industry":"Industry","case-data.scope":"Scope of work","dropdown.en":"English","dropdown.pl":"Polish","menu.home":"Home","menu.services":"What we do","menu.contact":"Contact us","menu.lang":"Language","menu.pl":"Polish","menu.en":"English","footer.contact":"Contact us","footer.newsletter":"Join our community and get our best insights, tips and strategies delivered straight to your inbox.","footer.email.placeholder":"Email address","footer.email.message":"That‚Äôs great!\nWe‚Äôll keep you updated!","footer.social":"Follow us on social media","footer.serivce":"Service","footer.about.h3":"About","footer.about.home":"Home","footer.support.h3":"Support","footer.support.policy":"Privacy policy","footer.support.cookie":"Cookie policy"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/blog/developmentprocessatexplaynpl","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2252100370","3259615022","389900197","63159454"]}
