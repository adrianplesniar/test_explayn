The sales funnels paid campaigns, and content shares &#8211; all paths lead there. Losing the users when they&#8217;re already at the website is a wasted potential &#8211; but you can avoid it with a good UI/UX design.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The rules of the game change depending on the sector. However, we&#8217;ve gathered a set of tried-and-true methods that will most likely make the user stay with you for longer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Good design practices to keep the user engaged</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can improve the conversion rate if your website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">leads the users through its structures without them even realizing it due to a well-thought architecture;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">adjusts to the users&#8217; needs and expectations by immediately providing them with what they&#8217;re looking for;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">has a refined interface that makes the navigation easier but catches the eye at the same time;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">is more intuitive due to good UX writing;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">has all its visual elements (bars, illustrations, widgets, colors, typography, etc.) harmonized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The elements listed above are the general assumptions worth making when rethinking your website&#8217;s concept or optimizing it. To stand out from the digital crowd, it&#8217;s worth combining these principles with the freshest trends in the UI/UX. Need an update on these? We&#8217;ve gathered the most significant tendencies to save you some research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#1 Simplified UX</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We won&#8217;t reinvent the wheel with this advice, but it&#8217;s always worth reminding &#8211; simplicity is the key to success in design, both when it comes to interface and user experience. Cutting down the number of steps necessary to finalize the registration process or purchase order will translate into increased conversion rates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#2 Mobile first</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/smartphone-user-mobile-shopping-preferences/\">Google Playbook Omnibus 2019</a>, 50% of smartphone users are more likely to use a mobile site when browsing or shopping on a smartphone just because they don&#8217;t want to download an app. That shows the importance of adjusting the website to the mobile interface. The online traffic coming from mobile devices will most likely continue to increase &#8211; take advantage of this tendency by optimizing the UX/UI! How? Prioritize the elements, optimize your pop-ups and navigation, and make sure the loading is fast enough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#3 Advanced personalization</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no better way to make the users feel special than providing them with a customized experience. Adjusting the content (headlines, illustrations, copy) to the specific user can result in skyrocketing conversion rates. What else can you personalize? Suggestions of products and services, featured blog posts, CTA&#8217;s, greetings, portfolio displays &#8211; the scope is broad!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#4 3D</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3D elements have become an integral part of a designer&#8217;s playbook in recent years. The three-dimensional elements and illustrations add some additional depth to the interface and make the user experience even more engaging and playful. At the same time, 3D makes the website corresponds to reality to a greater extent. That may be beneficial in some industries &#8211; from IT to e-commerce.</p>\n<h2><b>#5 Motion elements</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Talking about the engaging experience, we have to mention animations. Motion elements are the best way to keep the users&#8217; attention and spark their curiosity. Besides being a sort of diversion, they also serve as a tool to smoothly navigate the visitors through the website. Using the motion elements, you can introduce captivating storytelling and explain things in a simplified yet attractive manner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Incorporating these strategies in the design of your website can help you with achieving the business goals. Or you may pass this task to someone else&#8217;s hands to save time and effort &#8211; we&#8217;re more than ready to take up this challenge!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","leadText":"With the online traffic reaching peaks during the pandemic, the companies have stood a chance to achieve their business goals within a short period.

The sales funnels paid campaigns, and content shares &#8211; all paths lead there. Losing the users when they&#8217;re already at the website is a wasted potential &#8211; but you can avoid it with a good UI/UX design.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The rules of the game change depending on the sector. However, we&#8217;ve gathered a set of tried-and-true methods that will most likely make the user stay with you for longer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Good design practices to keep the user engaged</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can improve the conversion rate if your website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">leads the users through its structures without them even realizing it due to a well-thought architecture;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">adjusts to the users&#8217; needs and expectations by immediately providing them with what they&#8217;re looking for;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">has a refined interface that makes the navigation easier but catches the eye at the same time;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">is more intuitive due to good UX writing;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">has all its visual elements (bars, illustrations, widgets, colors, typography, etc.) harmonized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The elements listed above are the general assumptions worth making when rethinking your website&#8217;s concept or optimizing it. To stand out from the digital crowd, it&#8217;s worth combining these principles with the freshest trends in the UI/UX. Need an update on these? We&#8217;ve gathered the most significant tendencies to save you some research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#1 Simplified UX</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We won&#8217;t reinvent the wheel with this advice, but it&#8217;s always worth reminding &#8211; simplicity is the key to success in design, both when it comes to interface and user experience. Cutting down the number of steps necessary to finalize the registration process or purchase order will translate into increased conversion rates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#2 Mobile first</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/smartphone-user-mobile-shopping-preferences/\">Google Playbook Omnibus 2019</a>, 50% of smartphone users are more likely to use a mobile site when browsing or shopping on a smartphone just because they don&#8217;t want to download an app. That shows the importance of adjusting the website to the mobile interface. The online traffic coming from mobile devices will most likely continue to increase &#8211; take advantage of this tendency by optimizing the UX/UI! How? Prioritize the elements, optimize your pop-ups and navigation, and make sure the loading is fast enough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#3 Advanced personalization</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no better way to make the users feel special than providing them with a customized experience. Adjusting the content (headlines, illustrations, copy) to the specific user can result in skyrocketing conversion rates. What else can you personalize? Suggestions of products and services, featured blog posts, CTA&#8217;s, greetings, portfolio displays &#8211; the scope is broad!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>#4 3D</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3D elements have become an integral part of a designer&#8217;s playbook in recent years. The three-dimensional elements and illustrations add some additional depth to the interface and make the user experience even more engaging and playful. At the same time, 3D makes the website corresponds to reality to a greater extent. That may be beneficial in some industries &#8211; from IT to e-commerce.</p>\n<h2><b>#5 Motion elements</b></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Talking about the engaging experience, we have to mention animations. Motion elements are the best way to keep the users&#8217; attention and spark their curiosity. Besides being a sort of diversion, they also serve as a tool to smoothly navigate the visitors through the website. Using the motion elements, you can introduce captivating storytelling and explain things in a simplified yet attractive manner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Incorporating these strategies in the design of your website can help you with achieving the business goals. Or you may pass this task to someone else&#8217;s hands to save time and effort &#8211; we&#8217;re more than ready to take up this challenge!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","leadText":"With the online traffic reaching peaks during the pandemic, the companies have stood a chance to achieve their business goals within a short period.

It aims at clients that search for an affordable meal delivery option without compromising quality. Torba Smaku focuses on diet catering - with slimming, ketogenic, sports, and vegetarian variants included. ","torbasmaku.case-about.p2":"Its offer proves that the prepped meal delivery services can be affordable and keep the highest quality in terms of taste, products, and nutritional value.","torbasmaku.case-about.p3":"When launching this project, our main goals inculded","torbasmaku.case-about.li1":"creating a consistent image of a leader withing the low-cost catering services category","torbasmaku.case-about.li2":"launching sales and expanding it within a short span","torbasmaku.case-work-subject.h2":"What did we work on?","torbasmaku.case-work-subject.p1":"We’ve taken an active part in the brand development process from scratch, helping our client introduce the company to the market. In a few steps, which we’ll describe briefly below, we’ve created an online platform, visual identification, and marketing strategy, which was later implemented with satisfying results.","torbasmaku.case-work-subject.p2":"The first step was to create a platform for ordering personalized meal kit delivery services. Subsequently, we've made two video ads aimed at the YouTube campaigns to take off with the promotion in the most efficient way. At the same time, we’ve launched Google Ads and Facebook Ads campaigns, which have allowed us to gain new audience and increase the site traffic.","torbasmaku.case-work-project.h3":"PROJECT CHARACTERISTIC","torbasmaku.case-work-project.h2":"Challenges","torbasmaku.case-work-project.p1":"Developing this project, we had to keep the specifics of the catering industry in mind.  Since it aims towards a personalization, the company’s offer had to be as customizable as possible. That’s why all the diet variants have at least five levels of caloric content, and the clients can personalize their orders during the purchase process.  At the same time, the competition in the diet catering sector is relatively high, regardless of the price range. To attract potential customers, an extended offer adjusted to different needs and diet restrictions is not enough. ","torbasmaku.case-work-project.p2":"Thus, an intuitive website that catches the eye with its modern layout was our starting point, followed by a well-targeted marketing campaign.  Since it’s not that easy to stand out from the multitude of companies offering relatively similar catering services, we had to choose one distinguishing feature to focus on, which is, in a nutshell, „cheap but good” (with an emphasis on good!).","torbasmaku.case-work-project.p3":" ","torbasmaku.case-work-structure.h2":"Research and structure","torbasmaku.case-work-structure.p1":"During the research phase, we came up with a conclusion that the office workers dominate among the company’s target groups. Since they’re busy, they usually search for the fastest solutions. Thus, when designing the user journey, we’ve tried to reduce the order process to four simple steps. This way, the client can finalize the order in a minute or two. Through the website, the clients of Torba Smaku can access the client panel, where all their previous and current orders are stored. They can modify them, add special requests and manage their payments.","torbasmaku.case-work-structure.p2":" ","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.h2":"Aesthetics","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.p1":"In the website’s color palette, pastel shades are dominating, with mint green and pale blue as the main ones. Green brings calmness and associations with nature and harmony, while blue evokes trust. However, we’ve left much space for white, going for a modern, transparent design that exposes the appetizing photographs of offered dishes. ","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.p2":"We’ve made them in minimalistic arrangements, keeping the shots simple to bring out the maximum potential of the meals. Each diet is illustrated with various photos to give the potential clients an exact idea of what they can expect. The readable, sans serif Work Sans and Poppins fonts are in perfect harmony with the design. The modern approach to UI design distinguishes Torba Smaku from other companies in this price range, as most of them still operate on quite old-school interfaces.","torbasmaku.case-work-branding.p3":" ","torbasmaku.case-work-development.h2":"Website","torbasmaku.case-work-development.p1":"Since most clients tend to order diet catering services online, a fully responsive, beautiful online platform was a must. We made sure that the website is intuitive on different devices, including smartphones which are taking over the online traffic (in 2021, they already constitute 54% of all global traffic on the Internet).","torbasmaku.case-work-marketing.h2.marketing":"Marketing ","torbasmaku.case-work-marketing.h2.campaing":"campaing","torbasmaku.case-work-marketing.p1":"Marketing campaign: The introduction of the new brand to the market could go unnoticed without a well-targeted brand promotion. Our client decided to bet on a YouTube campaign since it’s the easiest way to reach broad recognition within a short time. To reach out to clients through social media, we’ve used Facebook Ads, too. Google Ads campaign made up to the overall promotion, allowing us to access the target group directly and spark its interest. ","torbasmaku.case-work-visual.h2":"Video ads","torbasmaku.case-work-visual.p1":"Our job was to create two video ads with the brand ambassador - Michał Wiśniewski, a known musician. Since he’s not related to the gastronomy industry anyhow, finding the common ground wasn’t easy. We came up with an idea of a musical kitchen. To create a commercial jingle, we’ve used the kitchen sounds, combining them with Michał’s vocal.","torbasmaku.case-work-visual.p2":" ","case-data.country":"Country","case-data.client":"Client","case-data.industry":"Industry","case-data.scope":"Scope of work","dropdown.en":"English","dropdown.pl":"Polish","menu.home":"Home","menu.services":"What we do","menu.contact":"Contact us","menu.lang":"Language","menu.pl":"Polish","menu.en":"English","footer.contact":"Contact us","footer.newsletter":"Join our community and get our best insights, tips and strategies delivered straight to your inbox.","footer.email.placeholder":"Email address","footer.email.message":"That’s great!\nWe’ll keep you updated!","footer.social":"Follow us on social media","footer.serivce":"Service","footer.about.h3":"About","footer.about.home":"Home","footer.support.h3":"Support","footer.support.policy":"Privacy policy","footer.support.cookie":"Cookie policy"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/blog/uiuxtrends","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2252100370","3259615022","389900197","63159454"]}
